This repository has all the the software and hardware info to make a door security system based on arduino.

The system is based on a arduino nano v.3, tty bluetooth device, 4x3 touchpad, buzzer [see hardware list](hardware_list.txt). It can store up to 150 passowrs (6 digits passwd) and has one admin to manage users. The acces can be done by the 4x3 touchpad ou by bluetooth with the software or simple Serial commands.

The [arduino code](codigo_arduino_final/codigo_arduino_final.ino) 

The tests for [hardware/software parts](teste_software_etapas)

The [electronic bcb](pcb_board)

The software for serial commands is for android only and was develloped in the simple MIT appinventor [1], the .aia file can be used to install the software on android or tweek and coustomise it.
